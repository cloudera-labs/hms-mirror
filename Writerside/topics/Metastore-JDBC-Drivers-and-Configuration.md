# Metastore JDBC Drivers and Configuration

For some data points, we revert to direct access to the metastore RDBMS.  To support this, you need to place the appropriate  
JDBC drivers for the metastore RDBMS in `$HOME/.hms-mirror/aux_libs` directory. 

You'll have to get the drivers from your RDBMS vendor.
