    The conversion will simple review the RIGHT schema's and convert the NAMESPACE from the LEFT

    Using the LEFT cluster configuration (or RIGHT when `-f|--flip` is used), migrate the tables from

    the metastores `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` for MANAGED (ACID) tables and `hive.metastore.warehouse.external.dir`
    for EXTERNAL tables. As an alternative, the LOCATION and MANAGEDLOCATION properties of the database can be
    configured/changed to a combination of the `-sms`, `-smn|-cs`, `-wd`, and `-ewd`.<p/>

    For ALL:
    We need to alter the database LOCATION and MANAGEDLOCATION properties to a default that relies on the new target
    namespace

    For SCHEMA_ONLY:
    This would be a change to the LOCATION of the 'table' and 'partitions'.  This applies to EXTERNAL tables. For this
    strategy we're assuming the data would be moved via 'distcp'.  See the 'distcp' reports for a shell of what we expect.
    We can NOT move ACID tables this way.

    This option is least desirable because files aren't rewritten (consolidate) and the locations for ALL partitions needs
    to be changed.  Consider removing as option.

    For SQL:
    We'll create 'target' tables rooted on the new namespace and then use SQL to migrate the data from the old table to
    the new table.  We'll rename the old table to an archive before the data is moved.  The new table will have the same
    name as the original.

    For EXPORT_IMPORT:
    Rename Table, EXPORT to export dir.  Create table with original name on the new namespace and IMPORT.

    For HYBRID:
    Choose either EXPORT_IMPORT or SQL.

    We won't automatically DROP old data.  But we will build a script that will drop the tables we rename to facilitate
    this process.
